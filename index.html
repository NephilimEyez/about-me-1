        <p>Hello! My name is ChristianRhey Tojot. And yes, that is my full first name. I currently live in Bothell, WA. The dream is to start working for a big gaming company before I get too old for games. I've tried going to colleges but becuase of certain circumstances I was never able to complete it. But now I am back and ready to continue my journey. I previously had little experience in Information Technology. One of my hobbies is building computers so I thought why not try to make that a career. I started the path fixing smartphones at T-Mobile stores. Unfortunately, I was laid off from the job and decided that maybe I wanted to do something else. And that's pretty much how I ended up here at Code Fellows. Being a grown man that still plays video games, I thought maybe I wanted to be a part of a game's creation.</p>
